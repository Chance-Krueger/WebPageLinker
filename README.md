# WebPageLinker
This C program builds a directed graph of web pages and their links from input commands. It adds pages and links, then uses depth-first search to check if one page can reach another via links. It outputs 1 if connected, 0 if not. Errors are reported but donâ€™t stop processing. Input is from a file or stdin.
